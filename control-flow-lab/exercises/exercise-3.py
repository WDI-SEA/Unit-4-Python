# exercise-03 Calculate Dog Years

# Write the code that:
# 1. Prompts the user to enter a dog's age in human years like this:
#      Input a dog's age in human years: 
# 2. Calculates the equivalent dog years, where:
#      - The first two years count as 10 years each
#      - Any remaining years count as 7 years each
# 3. Prints the answer in the following format:
#      The dog's age in dog years is xx

# Hint:  Use the int() function to convert the string returned from input() into an integer

dog_input = int(input("Enter a dog age"))
if(dog_input>2):
    two_first = 20
    the_rest = (dog_input-2)*7
    final = two_first+the_rest
else:
    final = dog_input*10
    
print(f"The dog's age in dog years is {final}")
