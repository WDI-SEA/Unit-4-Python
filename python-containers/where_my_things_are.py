# Define a Python dictionary named where_my_things_are containing a few items where:

# the keys are things you have, and
# the values are the locations you keep those things.
# Write a for loop that iterates over the items in the dictionary and prints each one as
# My [thing] is kept [location]

where_my_things_are = {
   
    'car key':'On my rooms nightstand inside a container',
    'Memories box':'On my desktop',
