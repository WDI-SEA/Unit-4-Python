![](http://jingabrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nye-wide.jpg)

### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** 
This will be your most advanced project to date.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure your project is **something that represents the breadth of your learning**, and make sure it's **something that looks nice**!

As always, Project Weeks will be a mix of standups and office hours. And this time, we'll be having optional advanced lectures during office hours time as well.

### Project Objectives

- Write code you want people to read, code that you're proud of and want to show off (DRY, properly indented, etc.)
- Build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real MVP)
- Build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding features to it after the course.)
- Manage your time and emotions well (remember: this is a test-run for your life post-course)

### Technical Requirements

You will be working individually or as a team on this project. Teams will have more stringent requirements for standup attendance and proof-of-progress (e.g. checking git commits) with their squad lead.

Your app must:

* **Be a full-stack application** with frontend *and* backend code
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible
* **Use something we didn't teach in class**

The backend can be either Express, Flask or Django and the database can be Mongo or Postgres (Mongo does not play well with Django, but Postgres can play well with Express if you're feeling adventurous)

You can build a react frontend, but for certain projects that are backend / data intensive, then server-side rendering using templating e.g. `ejs`, `handlebars`,  `django templating`, or `jinja` might be needed.

We'll be looking into some alternative hosting services (e.g. AWS) and perhaps a few others as Heroku has eliminated it's free tier. You are free to use whichever platform you would like, however, instructional support will be limited on these platforms so you're on your own to make these work.

### Timeline

- A Github repo
- A `readme.md` in your repo with:
	- A single paragraph description of what you want your project to be
	- a list of what technologies you plan to use 

 - Proof of full MVC on backend (but not full CRUD)
 - Proof of connection of Frontend + Backend
 - Seed Data in the database + displaying

- Demonstration of deployment with list of what's working / what's not.
- Demonstration of Readme at least 75% done.

You should have:

* A **working, full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project with **feature branches** (you can delete your branches once they are merged to your master branch, the merges will still show in the commit history).
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * A screenshot of your completed application
    * Explanations of the **technologies** and **concepts** used
    * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for a potential employer to clone down and run your app locally
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * BONUS: a table of your **routes** with their **auth** requirements


You should be prepared to give a short presentation (5-10 minutes) during which you:

- demo your application
- show a little bit of code (not all of your code)
- tell the class what you are most proud of, and what feature you are going to implement next

After you've finished your presentation, you will have a little time to answer questions from the class about your work.

### Asking For Help

#### Scrums

Once a day, typically at the beginning of class, the scrum master will lead a 10 minute scrum
meeting with each group to talk about progress and planning. During the standup, each
person should cover:
- what was worked on the day before
- what will be worked on that day
- any obstacles that could jeopardize project deadlines

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**. If you are using any technologies that we have not taught in class, we will of course still help you, but we will not teach the new technologies to you during project week - that's all you!
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent** with your code style.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** There is no excuse for non-perfect indentation. Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc? (If you're struggling with indentation, now is your last chance to practice before you're out in the world, so take advantage of this time!)
* **Comment your code** where it makes sense. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function?
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Potential Project Ideas

### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some
other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer
game.

### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI
save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts &
important document you need to have backed up.

### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread
messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we
know it.
